# My Kluster Controller

# Code Generation Instructions

Code generation: Make the `hack/codegen.sh` file properly. Read the comments properly. I faced issues while applying bash `hack/codegen.sh`. It wasn't working properly. You have to define the `types.go`, `register.go`, and `doc.go` files appropriately. And before running the `hack/codegen.sh`, make sure you installed the `controller-gen` first and double-check the directories.
